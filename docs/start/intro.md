Sandstone is a Typescript library for Minecraft Datapacks. It allows easy creation, debug and sharing of Minecraft functions, loot tables, predicates etc...

## Features

### Perfect autocompletion

Sandstone tells you what a command expects, and autocomplete complicated arguments for you.

You don't need to remember commands syntax anymore.

This autocompletion works for commands, predicates, loot tables, advancements...

:::note
Custom loot tables, predicates and advancements are not yet implemented.

### Easy to share
Sharing commands has **never been easier**. Just publish your functions on NPM, and everyone can use them to improve their own datapacks.

### Designed for developers
Sandstone is designed with developer experience in mind. The goal is to provide a beautiful library, easy to understand and to use, with enough abstractions to empower Datapack creators.
